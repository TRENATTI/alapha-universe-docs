As one of Alpha Authority's official groups on Roblox, VAA serves a tremendous purpose in the Authority. If not self-explanatory, members part of the VAA are confirmed Alpha Authority Veterans. Compared to non-veteran members, members in VAA have more access to adminstrative systems, games areas, historical archives, and one of Alpha Authority's largest community servers (The word is censored, so we'll just say Dizzy, the purple and blue gaming iconed platform).\n\n〢 We are able to check the full audit logs and purchase logs in Alpha Authority. These logs in-turn have allowed us to verify individuals who pended for this group, whether if its a change of rank or a accepted join request or a bought piece of clothing. If you ever joined Alpha Authority, it is likely we'll have logs for you, and we will accept you into this group if so.\n\n≺ Stats ≻\n\n〢 Comms Established ⋅ March 2017\n\n〢 Group Established ⋅ June 2019","owner":{"hasVerifiedBadge":false,"userId":1006857219,"username":"AUMissionControl","displayName":"AUMissionControl"},"shout":{"body":"Hiya!
