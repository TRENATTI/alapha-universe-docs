Created in 2013 as a War Clan, we've been on the Bloxy Award nominations, had over 31,000 users in our group player base, and had hundreds to join in single events. We are a valiant force to be reckoned with, symbolized by the White Wolf: Family, Teamwork, Loyalty, Ferocity, Survival.\n\n⋅ It is our philosophy that fun derives true success for each player in our clan.
